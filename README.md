**SwitchMediator: A Blazing Fast, Source-Generated Mediator for .NET**

SwitchMediator provides a high-performance implementation of the mediator pattern, offering an API surface familiar to users of popular libraries like [MediatR](https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR). By leveraging **C# Source Generators**, SwitchMediator eliminates runtime reflection for handler discovery and dispatch, instead generating highly optimized `switch` statements at compile time (this is done using a static readonly Dictionary that gets constructed at startup for O(1) execution regardless of the number of request / events you might have). We also want you to <em>**Switch**</em> your <em>**Mediator**</em> to ours, get it? üòâ

Aside from performance, SwitchMediator is first and foremost designed to overcome frequent community frustrations with MediatR, addressing factors that have hindered its wider adoption.

**The result? Faster execution, improved startup times, step-into debuggability, and compile-time safety.**

## Why SwitchMediator?

Traditional mediator implementations often rely on runtime reflection to discover handlers and construct pipelines. While flexible, this approach can introduce overhead:

*   **Runtime Performance Cost:** Reflection and dictionary lookups add latency to every request dispatch.
*   **Startup Delay:** Scanning assemblies and building internal mappings takes time when your application starts.
*   **Debugging Complexity:** Stepping through the mediator logic can involve navigating complex internal library code, delegates, and reflection calls.
*   **Trimming/AOT Challenges:** Reflection can make code less friendly to .NET trimming and Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation scenarios.

**SwitchMediator tackles these issues head-on by moving the work to compile time.** The source generator creates explicit C# code with direct handler calls and optimized `switch` statements, offering a "pay-as-you-go" approach where the cost is incurred during build, not at runtime.

## Key Advantages Over Reflection-Based Mediators

*   üöÄ **Maximum Performance:** Eliminates runtime reflection and dictionary lookups for dispatch. Uses compile-time `switch` statements and direct method calls. Ideal for performance-critical paths and high-throughput applications.
*   üßê **Enhanced Debuggability:** You can directly **step into the generated `SwitchMediator.g.cs` file**! See the exact `switch` statement matching your request, observe the explicit nesting of pipeline behavior calls (`await next(...)`), and step directly into your handler code. This provides unparalleled transparency compared to debugging reflection-based dispatch logic.
*   ‚úÖ **Compile-Time Safety:** Handler discovery happens during the build. Missing request handlers result in **build errors**, not runtime exceptions, catching issues earlier in the development cycle.
*   ‚úÇÔ∏è **Trimming / AOT Friendly:** Avoids runtime reflection, making the dispatch mechanism inherently more compatible with .NET trimming and AOT compilation. (Note: Ensure handlers and dependencies are also trimming/AOT safe).
*   üîç **Explicitness:** The generated code serves as clear, inspectable documentation of how requests are routed and pipelines are constructed for each message type.

## Features

*   Request/Response messages (`IRequest<TResponse>`, `IRequestHandler<TRequest, TResponse>`)
*   Notification messages (`INotification`, `INotificationHandler<TNotification>`)
*   Pipeline Behaviors (`IPipelineBehavior<TRequest, TResponse>`) for cross-cutting concerns.
*   Native support for Result pattern (e.g. [FluentResults](https://github.com/altmann/FluentResults)).
*   Flexible Pipeline Behavior Ordering via `[PipelineBehaviorOrder(int order)]`.
*   Pipeline Behavior Constraints using standard C# generic constraints (`where TRequest : ...`).
*   Explicit Notification Handler Ordering via DI configuration.
*   Seamless integration with `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection`.

## Installation

You'll typically need two packages:

1. **`Mediator.Switch.SourceGenerator`:** The SwitchMediator source generator itself, typically in the outermost project where your mediator related classes would reside. The source generator assembly does *not* get packaged with your application.
2. **`Mediator.Switch.Extensions.Microsoft.DependencyInjection`:** (Optional) Provides extension methods for easy registration with the standard .NET DI container. You can always manually register your DI instances.

```bash
dotnet add package Mediator.Switch.SourceGenerator
dotnet add package Mediator.Switch.Extensions.Microsoft.DependencyInjection
```

## Usage Example

Refer to [Sample app](src/Sample.ConsoleApp) for more information.

### DI Setup

Register SwitchMediator and its dependencies (handlers, behaviors, validators) in your application's composition root (e.g., `Program.cs`).

```csharp
using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
using Mediator.Switch;
using Mediator.Switch.Extensions.Microsoft.DependencyInjection;
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public static class Program
{
    public static async Task Main()
    {
        var services = new ServiceCollection();

        // --- SwitchMediator Registration ---
        // 1. Register SwitchMediator itself.
        services.AddMediator<SwitchMediator>(op =>
        {
            // 2. Pass compile-time pre-discovered types containing handlers, messages, behaviors for scanning and specify service lifetime.
            op.KnownTypes = SwitchMediator.KnownTypes;
            op.ServiceLifetime = ServiceLifetime.Singleton;
            // 3. Optionally, specify notification handler order.
            op.OrderNotificationHandlers<UserLoggedInEvent>(
                typeof(UserLoggedInLogger),
                typeof(UserLoggedInAnalytics)
            );
        });

        // --- Build and Scope ---
        var serviceProvider = services.BuildServiceProvider();
        using var scope = serviceProvider.CreateScope(); // Simulate a request scope

        var sender = scope.ServiceProvider.GetRequiredService<ISender>();
        var publisher = scope.ServiceProvider.GetRequiredService<IPublisher>();

        // --- Execute Logic ---
        await RunSampleLogic(sender, publisher);
    }

    public static async Task RunSample(ISender sender, IPublisher publisher)
    {
        // See next section
    }
}
```

### Sending Requests & Publishing Notifications

Inject `ISender` and `IPublisher` into your services (controllers, etc.) and use them to dispatch messages.

```csharp
// Inside the RunSampleLogic method from above

public static async Task RunSample(ISender sender, IPublisher publisher)
{
    Console.WriteLine("--- Sending GetUserRequest ---");
    string userResult = await sender.Send(new Sample.GetUserRequest(123));
    Console.WriteLine($"--> Result: {userResult}\n");

    Console.WriteLine("--- Sending CreateOrderRequest ---");
    int orderResult = await sender.Send(new Sample.CreateOrderRequest("Gadget"));
    Console.WriteLine($"--> Result: {orderResult}\n");

    Console.WriteLine("--- Publishing UserLoggedInEvent ---");
    await publisher.Publish(new Sample.UserLoggedInEvent(123));
    Console.WriteLine("--- Notification Published ---\n");

    Console.WriteLine("--- Sending Request with Validation Failure ---");
    try
    {
        await sender.Send(new Sample.GetUserRequest(-1));
    }
    catch (FluentValidation.ValidationException ex)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"--> Caught Expected ValidationException: {ex.Errors.FirstOrDefault()?.ErrorMessage}\n");
    }
}
```
